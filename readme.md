#Valentine's Date Generator

This is the first command line app I ever wrote based off of my early learning from Codecademy. I've moved it to Github mainly for nostalgic purposes and to remind myself how far I've come.

##To use:

The application can be used on systems equipped with Ruby by navigating to the proper folder and typing the file name **date_generator.rb** into the command line.
